    NixCacheInfo:
      type: object
      required:
        - StoreDir
        - WantMassQuery
        - Priority
      properties:
        StoreDir:
          type: string
          description: The path of the Nix store to which this binary cache applies.
                       Binaries are not relocatable — a binary built for /nix/store won’t generally work in /home/alice/store
                       — so to prevent binaries from being used in a wrong store, a binary cache is only used if its StoreDir
                       matches the local Nix configuration. The default is /nix/store.
          example: /nix/store
        WantMassQuery:
          type: integer
          description: Query operations such as nix-env -qas can cause thousands of cache queries,
                       and thus thousands of HTTP requests, to determine which packages are available in binary form.
                       While these requests are small, not every server may appreciate a potential onslaught of queries.
                       If WantMassQuery is set to 0 (default), “mass queries” such as nix-env -qas will skip this cache.
                       Thus a package may appear not to have a binary substitute. However, the binary will still be used
                       when you actually install the package. If WantMassQuery is set to 1, mass queries will use this cache.
        Priority:
          type: integer
          description: Each binary cache has a priority (defaulting to 50).
                       Binary caches are checked for binaries in order of ascending priority;
                       thus a higher number denotes a lower priority.
                       The binary cache https://cache.nixos.org has priority 40.
